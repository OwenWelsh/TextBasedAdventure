With the first draft of the game's engine now finished, I've started developing the game's world.

The general "architecture" of the code is Globals -> Utilities -> Item -> Player.  Player leads into Menu and Location.  Location leads into all of the LocationX files, which are consolidated in Locations.h, which, along with Menu, leads into Game, finishing with Main.cpp.

Started on December 5th, 2012.  Many thanks to Daniel Scanlan, who figured out the cause of a bug that would have killed this project early on had he not caught it.

Notes for developer:
